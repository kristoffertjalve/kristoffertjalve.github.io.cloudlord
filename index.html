                    data-text="Kristoffer Tjalve is the owner-operator of Cloudlord.management. He works as an independent curator, writer and organizer from his studio in Athens, Greece. He is dedicated to the web as a medium, material, and philosophy, and his surreal estates reach millions of visitors and attract the attention of emerging and established designers, developers, curators, and educators.

                    <br><br>

                    Kristoffer works across disciplines and formats, from websites to awards, conferences, and printed publications. His practice is centered around nurturing environments where emerging practitioners and narratives flourish. Thatâ€™s why he often uses the poetic web as a metaphor for opening new possibilities through ambiguity, naivety, curiosity, and care.

                    <br><br>

                    Kristoffer studied business and philosophy at Copenhagen Business School, with semesters at Singapore Management University and Bocconi University. This led him to a career path of consulting C-levels at companies like Daimler Trucks Asia and Rhomberg Holding. However, since the pandemic and the birth of his son in 2020, Kristoffer has increasingly devoted himself to keeping the internet flame alive.
