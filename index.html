It features 200+ links to different internet philosophies and movements. The feeling I'm trying to provoke is that of  the starry night in a remote area because sometimes it is hard to see the depth and scale of the universe when caught inside an urban environment, or in the case of the internet, when we are stuck inside social media.

                    <br><br>

                    I believe handmade maps offer an intriguing alternative to navigate space. They are not trying to make a 1:1 representation of reality, but to recall walks that are eithter important or worthy - and to share them with others.

                    Maybe Tiny Awards can be a Trojan horse that brings personal websites, community archives, and HTML poems into rigid arts institutions? Maybe, one day, green cards will be given because of Tiny Awards?

                    data-text="Kristoffer Tjalve is the owner-operator of Cloudlord.management. He works as an independent curator, writer and organizer from his studio in Athens, Greece. He is dedicated to the web as a medium, material, and philosophy, and his surreal estates reach millions of visitors and attract the attention of emerging and established designers, developers, curators, and educators.

                    <br><br>

                    Kristoffer works across formats, from websites to awards, conferences, and printed publications. His practice is centered around nurturing environments where emerging practitioners and narratives flourish. Thatâ€™s why he often uses the poetic web as a metaphor for opening new possibilities through ambiguity, naivety, curiosity, and care.

                    <br><br>

                    Kristoffer studied business and philosophy at Copenhagen Business School, with semesters at Singapore Management University and Bocconi University. This led him to a career path of consulting C-levels at companies like Daimler Trucks Asia and Rhomberg Holding. However, since the pandemic and the birth of his son in 2020, Kristoffer has increasingly devoted himself to keeping the internet flame alive.
